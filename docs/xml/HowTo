Quick and dirty guide to generating our documentation
=====================================================

1. Preparations
---------------

To transform the Readme/FAQ/Exult Studio documentation you need xsltproc.
This is usually either bundled with libxslt, or a standalone package
dependent on it. Here is how you can install it on a few common platforms
(probably needing to add `sudo`):

- MSYS2 on Windows:
    pacman -S --noconfirm libxslt
- Chocolatey on Windows:
    choco install xsltproc
- vcpkg:
    vcpkg install libxslt
- ArchLinux:
    pacman -S --noconfirm libxslt
- Debian/Ubuntu:
    apt install xsltproc
- Fedora/CentOS:
    dnf install libxslt
- FreeBSD:
    pkg install -y libxslt
- Homebrew on macOS:
    brew install libxslt
- MacPorts on macOS:
    port install libxslt

2. Generating the docs
----------------------

- Use the Makefile provided in the docs/xml directory by running "make".

- If you also want to update the files in exult-web, you can pass its
  directory to make as the variable WEB_DIR like this:

    make WEB_DIR=/path/to/exult-web

3. What the Makefile does
-------------------------

By running make you get docs.txt/html, exult_studio.txt/html,
and faq.txt/html in the docs/xml directory, as well as docs.html, 
faq.html and studio.html in the temporary docs/xml/web_tmp directory.

Additionally, make will perform the following updates:

- docs.txt will be copied as README in the root source directory

- faq.txt will be copied as FAQ in the root source directory

- docs.html will be copied as ReadMe.html in docs directory

- faq.html, exult_studio.html, and exult_studio.txt in docs will be
  updated with the newly generated files of the same names

- If you supplied WEB_DIR to make, then docs.txt/faq.txt/exult_studio.txt 
  and the html files in the directory docs/xml/web_tmp will be copied to
  "$WEB_DIR".
