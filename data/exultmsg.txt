0x526:Upon your return to Britain,
0x527:Lord British decreed that
0x528:The Fellowship be outlawed
0x529:and all of the branches were
0x52A:soon destroyed.
0x52B:
# End3
0x52C:The frustration you feel at having been
0x52D:stranded in Britannia is somewhat

0x530:by The Fellowship and even avenged the
0x531:death of Spark's father.

# End4
0x535:And although you are, at the moment,
0x536:helpless to do anything about
0x537:The Guardian's final threat,

0x539:what became of Batlin, the fiend
0x53A:who got away?
0x53B:
0x53C:
# End5

0x54C:Dick British's Castle
0x54D:Eighteen months after the destruction
0x54E:of the Black Gate and the
0x54F:dismantling of The Fellowship
0x550:My liege
0x551:Yo, homes
0x552:All we found among Batlin's
0x553:belongings was this enchanted scroll...
0x554:and a map showing the way to
0x555:a place called the Serpent Isle.
0x556:Indeed.
0x557:Put it on the table.
0x558:Iree. Slap it down there!
0x559:Stand Back!
0x55A:Jump Back!
0x55B:Batlin! In the event that the
0x55C:Avatar destroys the Black Gate
0x55D:you shall follow the unwitting
0x55E:human Gwenno to the Serpent Isle

0x565:Soon I and my horde of muppets will
0x566:destroy Britannia!
0x567:'Tis my worst fear!

0x572:Well well well, Avatar. You
0x573:have managed to thwart me once again.
0x574:By restoring balance where
0x575:once chaos reigned, you have
0x576:saved your accursed world.
0x577:But now here you are, poised
0x578:at the edge of Eternity.
0x579:Where would you go?
0x57A:Back to Britannia?
0x57B:To Earth?
0x57C:Perhaps you would join me in
0x57D:another world alltogether?
0x57E:We do have a score to settle!
0x57F:You have restored balance to
0x580:the Serpent Isle in
