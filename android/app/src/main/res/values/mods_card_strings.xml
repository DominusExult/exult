    <p><b><u>Pre-configured Mods</u></b><br/>
      Exult can optionally make use of mods that change the original games or add entirely
      new content. This android port is currently set up to make use of the three mods
      maintained by the Exult project, the excellent Ultima VI remake and Glimmerscape.
      You can either have this launcher download the mods from our download page and install
      it, or browse to the <a href="https://exult.info/download.html">Exult Downloads page</a>
      and download the mods you are interested in.
    </p>
    <p>
      After you have downloaded the .zip file(s), you can tap the corresponding checkboxes
      on the left. These will open a file browser which you can use to select the archive(s)
      you downloaded, and the installer will take care of extracting the required data files
      and installing them in the correct places.
    </p>
    <p><b><u>Other Mods</u></b><br/>
      If you wish to install a mod that is not listed on the left hand side, click the
      <b>INSTALL CUSTOM MOD</b> button. But be aware that these cannot be uninstalled from the
      launcher.
    </p>
    <p><b><u>Patches</u></b><br/>
      Similar to custom mods you can install patches that you downloaded from the
      <a href="https://exult.info/download.html">Exult Downloads page</a> by clicking the
      <b>INSTALL PATCH</b> button which will open a file dialog to select an archive. Next
      you will be asked for which game the patch should be installed. These patches cannot
      be uninstalled from the launcher either.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Once you have successfully installed the mod(s) or patches, you are free to delete
      the .zip files; they will no longer be needed or used by Exult after installation.
